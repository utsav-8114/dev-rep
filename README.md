Monolithic vs Microservices
Introduction
Software architecture has evolved significantly over time:

1980s–1990s → Monolithic applications on physical servers
2000s → N-tier applications with virtualization
Present → Microservices running in containers using Docker and Kubernetes
Microservices architecture became popular because modern applications require scalability, flexibility, and faster deployment.

Monolithic Architecture
A monolithic application is built as a single unified application where all components are tightly coupled.

It mainly contains:

User Interface (UI)
Business Logic
Database Access Layer
All modules are developed and deployed together.

Example of Monolithic Application
An E-commerce application where:

Frontend
Backend
Authentication
Payment
Database
are combined into one large application.

Advantages of Monolithic Architecture
Simple deployment
Easy debugging and testing
Faster internal communication
Suitable for small applications
Disadvantages of Monolithic Architecture
Difficult to scale specific modules
Large codebase becomes hard to manage
Technology upgrades become difficult
One failure can affect entire application
Slower development for large teams
Microservices Architecture
Microservices architecture divides an application into multiple small independent services.

Each service:

Performs a specific business task
Runs independently
Communicates using APIs
Can use its own database
Example of Microservices
An online shopping platform may contain:

User Service
Product Service
Payment Service
Order Service
Recommendation Service
Each service works independently.

Advantages of Microservices
Advantage	Description
Scalability	Services can scale independently
Independent Deployment	Update one service without affecting others
Fault Isolation	Failure in one service does not stop entire system
Technology Flexibility	Different technologies can be used
Faster Development	Teams can work independently
Easier Maintenance	Small services are easier to manage
Disadvantages of Microservices
Complex architecture
Difficult service communication
More deployment management
Monitoring becomes challenging
Requires container orchestration tools
Monolithic vs Microservices
Feature	Monolithic	Microservices
Architecture	Single application	Multiple independent services
Scalability	Entire app scaled together	Individual services scaled
Deployment	Single deployment	Independent deployment
Fault Isolation	Low	High
Flexibility	Less flexible	Highly flexible
Maintenance	Difficult for large apps	Easier due to smaller services
Technology Stack	Usually single stack	Multiple stacks possible
Role of Containers in Microservices
Microservices are commonly deployed using containers such as Docker.

Benefits:

Lightweight deployment
Faster startup time
Isolation between services
Better resource utilization
Easy scalability
Kubernetes is often used to manage multiple containers.

Real-World Examples
Netflix
Amazon
Flipkart
Swiggy
Zomato
These platforms use microservices to handle millions of users efficiently.

Important Viva Questions
1. What is a monolithic application?
A monolithic application is a single unified application where all components are tightly coupled and deployed together.

2. What are microservices?
Microservices are small independent services that work together to form an application.

3. Why are microservices preferred over monolithic architecture?
Because they provide scalability, flexibility, independent deployment, and fault isolation.

4. What is fault isolation in microservices?
Failure of one service does not affect the complete application.

5. Why are containers used in microservices?
Containers provide lightweight, isolated, and portable environments for running services.

Conclusion
Monolithic architecture is simple and suitable for small applications, while microservices architecture is better for large-scale modern applications requiring scalability, flexibility, and faster deployment.

Containers
Introduction
Containers are lightweight virtualization technologies that allow multiple isolated applications to run on a single operating system.

Containers package:

Application code
Dependencies
Libraries
Runtime environment
This makes applications portable and consistent across different systems.

What is a Container?
A container is an isolated environment that shares the host operating system kernel while running applications independently.

Containers are widely used in DevOps and cloud computing because they are:

Lightweight
Fast
Portable
Scalable
Features of Containers
OS-level virtualization
Lightweight compared to Virtual Machines
Fast startup time
Efficient resource utilization
Portable across environments
Isolation between applications
Containers vs Virtual Machines
Feature	Containers	Virtual Machines
Virtualization Type	OS-level virtualization	Hardware-level virtualization
Size	Lightweight	Heavy
Startup Time	Seconds	Minutes
Resource Usage	Low	High
OS Requirement	Shares host kernel	Separate guest OS
Performance	Faster	Slower compared to containers
Working of Containers
Containers use:

Namespaces → for process isolation
Control Groups (cgroups) → for resource limits
Container Runtime → to run containers
The host operating system kernel is shared among all containers.

Advantages of Containers
Faster deployment
Better resource utilization
Easy scalability
Consistent development environment
Simplified application deployment
High portability
Containers and Microservices
Containers are commonly used to deploy microservices.

Each microservice can run inside its own container with:

Required dependencies
Runtime environment
Libraries
Benefits:

Independent deployment
Fault isolation
Better scalability
Faster updates
Docker and Kubernetes
Docker
Docker is a containerization platform used to:

Build containers
Run containers
Manage container images
Kubernetes
Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool used to:

Manage multiple containers
Auto-scale applications
Self-heal failed containers
Handle container networking
Real-World Uses of Containers
Containers are widely used in:

Cloud applications
CI/CD pipelines
Microservices architecture
DevOps automation
Scalable web applications
Companies using containers:

Netflix
Amazon
Google
Spotify
Important Viva Questions
1. What is a container?
A container is a lightweight isolated environment used to run applications along with their dependencies.

2. Why are containers lightweight?
Because they share the host operating system kernel instead of running a separate OS.

3. What is the difference between containers and VMs?
Containers share the host OS kernel while VMs use separate guest operating systems.

4. What is Docker?
Docker is a platform used for containerization.

5. What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform used to manage multiple containers.

6. Why are containers useful in microservices?
Containers provide portability, scalability, and isolation for microservices deployment.

Dependency Management in Maven
What is Dependency Management?
Dependency management is the process of handling external libraries required by a project.

In Maven, dependencies are declared inside:

<dependencies>
</dependencies>
section of pom.xml.

Maven automatically:

downloads dependencies
manages versions
resolves dependency conflicts
Example Dependency
<dependency>
    <groupId>junit</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
    <version>4.13.2</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
Dependency Components
groupId
Identifies organization or library provider.

Example:

<groupId>junit</groupId>
artifactId
Represents library name.

Example:

<artifactId>junit</artifactId>
version
Specifies library version.

Example:

<version>4.13.2</version>
scope
Defines where dependency is available.

Example:

<scope>test</scope>
Dependency Scopes
1. compile
Default scope.

Available:

compile time
test time
runtime
Example:

Spring Core libraries
2. provided
Available during:

compile
test
NOT included at runtime.

Example:

Servlet API provided by Tomcat
3. runtime
Required only during runtime.

Example:

JDBC drivers
4. test
Available only during testing.

Example:

JUnit
Mockito
5. system
Uses local system JAR path.

Not recommended.

Transitive Dependencies
Maven automatically downloads dependencies required by other dependencies.

Example:

Project → Spring Boot → Logging Libraries
No need to manually add all libraries.

Dependency Conflict
Sometimes multiple versions of same library exist.

Example:

Library A → log4j 1.0
Library B → log4j 2.0
This creates version conflict.

Conflict Resolution
Maven uses:

Nearest Definition Wins
Nearest dependency in dependency tree is selected.

Excluding Dependencies
Unwanted dependencies can be removed using:

<exclusions>
    <exclusion>
        <groupId>com.example</groupId>
        <artifactId>old-lib</artifactId>
    </exclusion>
</exclusions>
Dependency Management Section
Used to centrally manage dependency versions.

Example:

<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>

    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
Advantages of Dependency Management
Automatic dependency download
Reduced manual work
Better version control
Easy project maintenance
Faster project setup
Important Viva Questions
1. What is dependency management in Maven?
Dependency management handles external libraries required by a project.

2. Where are dependencies declared?
Inside pom.xml.

3. What is dependency scope?
It defines where a dependency is available.

4. What are transitive dependencies?
Dependencies automatically downloaded by Maven for other dependencies.

5. What is dependency conflict?
When multiple versions of same library exist.

Introduction to GitHub Actions
What is GitHub Actions?
GitHub Actions is a CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) platform provided by GitHub.

It helps automate software workflows directly inside a GitHub repository.

Using GitHub Actions, developers can:

Build applications
Run tests
Deploy applications
Automate repetitive tasks
GitHub Actions workflows are written using YAML files. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

What is CI/CD?
Continuous Integration (CI)
Continuous Integration means automatically:

building code
testing code
validating changes
whenever developers push code.

Example:

Developer pushes code → automatic build → automatic tests.

Continuous Deployment (CD)
Continuous Deployment means automatically deploying applications after successful build and testing.

Example:

Code Push → Build → Test → Deploy.

Why Use GitHub Actions?

Jobs, Steps, Actions and Runners
Key Components of GitHub Actions
GitHub Actions workflows are built using several important components:

Jobs
Steps
Actions
Runners
These components define how automation workflows execute. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

1. Jobs
A job is a group of tasks executed inside a workflow.

Each workflow can contain one or multiple jobs.

Example:

jobs:
  build:
  test:
Characteristics:

Jobs run independently.
Jobs run in parallel by default.
Jobs can depend on other jobs.
Job Example
jobs:

  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - run: echo "Building Application"
Job Dependencies
Jobs can wait for another job using:

needs:
Example:

jobs:

  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
Here:

Build job executes first.
Deploy job runs after build completes.
2. Steps
Steps define individual commands executed inside a job.

Each job contains one or more steps.

Example:

steps:
  - name: Print Message
    run: echo "Hello GitHub Actions"
Characteristics:

Steps run sequentially.
Each step performs one task.
Can use commands or reusable actions.
Step Example
steps:

  - name: Install Dependencies
    run: npm install

  - name: Run Tests
    run: npm test
3. Actions
Actions are reusable workflow components.

Instead of writing everything manually, predefined actions can be used.

Syntax:

uses:
Example:

uses: actions/checkout@v4
Popular actions:

Action	Purpose
actions/checkout	Clone repository
actions/setup-java	Configure Java
actions/cache	Dependency caching
upload-artifact	Store build files
Example Action
steps:

  - name: Checkout Code
    uses: actions/checkout@v4
Purpose:

Downloads repository source code.

4. Runners
Runners are machines that execute workflows.

Each job requires a runner.

Defined using:

runs-on:
Example:

runs-on: ubuntu-latest
Types of Runners
GitHub Hosted Runner
Managed by GitHub.

Supported environments:

Ubuntu
Windows
macOS

# Java Maven CI using GitHub Actions

## What is Java Maven CI?

Java Maven CI uses **GitHub Actions** to automate Java application build and testing.

Continuous Integration (CI) automatically:

- builds Java project
- installs dependencies
- runs tests
- creates build artifacts

whenever code changes are pushed to GitHub.

---

# Why Use Maven in CI?

Maven helps automate:

- dependency management
- project compilation
- testing
- packaging

Common Maven commands:

```bash
mvn clean install
mvn test
```

---

# Java CI Workflow Components

A Java Maven workflow usually contains:

1. Checkout Repository
2. Setup JDK
3. Cache Maven Dependencies
4. Build Application
5. Run Tests
6. Upload Build Artifacts

These steps are commonly used in CI pipelines. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

---

# Example Workflow

Example `ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: Java CI with Maven

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:

  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:

      - name: Checkout Repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Java
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '21'
          distribution: 'temurin'

      - name: Build Project
        run: mvn clean install
```

---

# Setup Java Step

GitHub Actions uses:

```yaml
actions/setup-java
```

Example:

```yaml
uses: actions/setup-java@v4
```

Purpose:

- install JDK
- configure Java environment

---

# Maven Build Step

Command:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

Purpose:

- clean old builds
- download dependencies
- compile source code
- execute tests
- package application

---

# Run Tests

Command:

```bash
mvn test
```

Purpose:

Executes unit tests.

---

# Upload Artifacts

GitHub Actions can store build outputs.

Action:

```yaml
actions/upload-artifact
```

Example:

```yaml
- name: Upload Artifact
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
```

---

# Advantages

- Automated Java builds
- Faster testing
- Consistent CI process
- Dependency automation
- Artifact storage

---

# Important Viva Questions

Practical 01 — Docker + GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline
Aim
To create a Dockerized Python Flask application and automate its build process using GitHub Actions Continuous Integration (CI).

Problem Statement
Build a simple Flask application using Docker and configure GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build the Docker image whenever code is pushed to GitHub repository.

Solution
Step 1 — Create Flask Application
Created a simple Python Flask web application.

app.py

from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Hello from Docker CI/CD!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
Step 2 — Create Requirements File
requirements.txt

Flask
Step 3 — Create Dockerfile
Created Dockerfile for containerizing the Flask application.

FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY . .

RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

CMD ["python","app.py"]
Step 4 — Build Docker Image
Command used:

docker build --no-cache -t my-docker-app .
Step 5 — Run Docker Container
Command used:

docker run -p 5000:5000 my-docker-app
Output:

Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
Browser Output:

Hello from Docker CI/CD!
Step 6 — Create GitHub Actions Workflow
Created workflow file:

.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
Workflow automatically runs on every push to GitHub.

ci-cd.yml

name: CI-CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build Docker Image
        run: docker build -t my-docker-app .
Step 7 — Push Project to GitHub
Commands used:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Add Docker GitHub Actions workflow"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/AsthaMaurya05/my-docker-app.git
git push -u origin main
Step 8 — Verify GitHub Actions Workflow
After pushing code:

Workflow triggered automatically.
GitHub Actions pipeline executed successfully.
Docker image build completed successfully.
